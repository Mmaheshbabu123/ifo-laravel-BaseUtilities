    Packages\IfoBaseUtilities\HasNotDeletedScope
    Packages\IfoBaseUtilities\ResponseService

== Usage Hereâ€™s how to use each facade in your project:

=== AbstractApiService Use AbstractApiService to define reusable API service logic.

use Packages\IfoBaseUtilities\AbstractApiService;

$service = new AbstractApiService();
$response = $service->callEndpoint($url, $data);

=== AbstractModel Use AbstractModel as a base class for your Eloquent models.

use Packages\IfoBaseUtilities\AbstractModel;

class User extends AbstractModel {
    // Custom logic for the User model
}

=== BaseValidator BaseValidator simplifies validation logic for incoming requests.

use Packages\IfoBaseUtilities\BaseValidator;

$rules = [
    'email' => 'required|email',
    'password' => 'required|min:6',
];
$validator = BaseValidator::validate($data, $rules);

=== DecryptRequest Use DecryptRequest to decrypt incoming encrypted request payloads.

use Packages\IfoBaseUtilities\DecryptRequest;

$decryptedData = DecryptRequest::handle($request->input('data'));

=== EncryptResponse EncryptResponse is used to encrypt outgoing responses.

use Packages\IfoBaseUtilities\EncryptResponse;

$encryptedResponse = EncryptResponse::handle($data);
return response()->json($encryptedResponse);

=== HasNotDeletedScope Use HasNotDeletedScope to include a query scope for models that are not soft deleted.

use Packages\IfoBaseUtilities\HasNotDeletedScope;

$query = User::withoutTrashed()->get();

=== ResponseService Use ResponseService to send standardized API responses.

use Packages\IfoBaseUtilities\ResponseService;

return ResponseService::send('Data retrieved successfully', 200, $data);
